## Exercise List 1 – Basic Commands

Example 01 – Open a color image, display it, and save it.

Example 02 – Open a color image, convert it to grayscale, display it, and save the generated image.

Example 03 – Open a color image in RGB, display and save each of the channels separately. Note: Try to understand what each channel represents.

Example 04 – Open a color image, convert it to grayscale, and display the input image. Apply median (median) and mean (blur) low-pass filters, visualize the results, and save them. Note: Try to understand the effects of each filter.

Example 05 – Open a color image, convert it to grayscale, and display the input image. Apply thresholding, visualize the results, and save them. Note: Try to understand how this technique works.

Example 06 – Open a color image, convert it to grayscale, and apply histogram equalization using OpenCV. First, visualize the input image and its histogram, then display the equalized image and its histogram. This technique enhances the image contrast.



### OpenCV Library
Library Name: opencv-python

Brief Explanation: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library designed for real-time computer vision and image processing. It provides tools for handling images and videos, including functionalities like filtering, edge detection, object detection, and machine learning-based vision tasks.

### List Content
The exercise list focuses on fundamental image processing tasks using OpenCV, including image loading, grayscale conversion, color channel separation, **morphological operators**, filtering (median and blur), thresholding, and histogram equalization to enhance contrast.
